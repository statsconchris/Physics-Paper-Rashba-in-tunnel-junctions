# Physics Paper: Rashba-in-tunnel-junctions

#### Tools: Fortran + libcuba.a

*We develop the simple cubic tight-binding Hamiltonian within the Keldysh formalism to study
tunnel junctions in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. This model permits the direct
calculation of the anomalous and spin Hall effects, the anisotropic tunneling magnetoresistance, the
tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance, and the Rashba torque.*
